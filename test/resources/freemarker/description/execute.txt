	The execute command can be used to interact with the operating system.
	The execute command can open files or browse directories in the native file browser.
	Lastly, it can be used to invoke commands on the native command line.
</p>

<code>execute -cf | ls | grep 'm'</code><br/>
<p>For windows "cmd /c" will be invoked, for linux 'sh -c'. The piped command will be passed as an argument to the shell.</p>

<p>If this shell is unavailable, you can use the -s flag to separate arguments with spaces instead.</p>
<code>execute -csf | ls test dir</code><br/>
<p>
	Would invoke the ls command with the arguments "test" and "dir".
</p>
<p>
	Every word separated by whitespace is fed to the native command as a new argument.
	but this makes it impossible to use unix pipes '|' or redirects '>' and requires an ugly escape syntax for arguments with spaces in them.
	Whitespace in arguments needs to be escaped with "\w" and backslashes with "\b".
</p>

<code>execute -csf | ls test\wdir</code><br/>
<p>Would invoke the ls command with a single argument "test dir".</p>
